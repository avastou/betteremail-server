betteremail (server)
==================

The aim of this project is to provide a node.js based server, accessible with REST API, for improving the email experience.

Here is the list of goals of the project
 - [ ] Build an IMAP client, compliant with [rfc 4549](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4549.html)
 - [ ] Make it available through a RESTful web service
 - [ ] Add intelligence to the system (mainly unsupervised analysis for label assignment)

A betteremail-client parallel project is under developement, but it will not be published until the REST interface of the server will be stably defined
